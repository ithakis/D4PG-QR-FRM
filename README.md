# D4PG-QR-FRM: Distributional Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient with Advanced Extensions

## Algorithm Overview

**D4PG (Distributional Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient)** is a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithm that extends DDPG by incorporating distributional value learning. Instead of predicting scalar Q-values, D4PG learns the full distribution over returns, leading to more robust and sample-efficient learning.

### Key Features Implemented

This implementation extends the core D4PG algorithm with several advanced features:

- **ðŸŽ¯ Distributional Critic**: Uses **IQN (Implicit Quantile Networks)** instead of traditional C51 for improved distributional learning
- **ðŸš€ Munchausen RL**: Entropy-regularized policy improvement for enhanced exploration and stability
- **ðŸ§  D2RL Networks**: Deep dense architectures with skip connections for better gradient flow
- **âš¡ Prioritized Experience Replay (PER)**: Importance sampling for more efficient learning from experience
- **ðŸ”„ N-Step Bootstrapping**: Multi-step returns for faster value propagation
- **ðŸŒŠ Parallel Environments**: Vectorized environment support for accelerated training
- **ðŸŽ® Intrinsic Curiosity Module (ICM)**: Optional curiosity-driven exploration
- **ðŸ’¨ Performance Optimizations**: torch.compile, automatic mixed precision, and CPU/GPU optimizations

### D4PG Core Algorithm

The D4PG algorithm combines:

1. **Deterministic Policy Gradient**: Learn a deterministic policy Î¼(s) that maximizes expected return
2. **Distributional Value Learning**: Model the full return distribution Z(s,a) instead of just E[Z(s,a)]
3. **Target Networks**: Use slowly-updated target networks for stable learning
4. **Experience Replay**: Learn from past experiences stored in a replay buffer
5. **Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Noise**: Add temporally correlated noise for exploration

The distributional aspect allows the agent to model uncertainty in value estimates, leading to more robust decision-making and improved sample efficiency.
