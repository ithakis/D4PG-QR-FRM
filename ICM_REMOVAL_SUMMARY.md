# ICM Removal Summary

## Files Removed
- `scripts/ICM.py` - Completely removed the Intrinsic Curiosity Module implementation

## Files Modified

### `scripts/agent.py`
- Removed ICM imports (`from .ICM import ICM, Forward, Inverse`)
- Removed `curiosity` parameter from `__init__` method
- Removed `self.curiosity` and `self.reward_addon` attributes
- Removed ICM initialization block (lines 176-182)
- Removed ICM-related code from `learn_` method (curiosity calculation and reward modification)
- Removed ICM loss from return statement (now returns only critic_loss, actor_loss)
- Removed ICM loss logging from `step` method

### `run.py`
- Removed `--icm` and `--add_ir` argument parsers
- Removed ICM reward calculation in training loop
- Removed `curiosity_logs` variable and related logging
- Removed `curiosity=(args.icm, args.add_ir)` from Agent initialization
- Removed intrinsic reward logging to TensorBoard

### `enjoy.py`
- Removed `curiosity=(parameters.icm, parameters.add_ir)` from Agent initialization
- Removed `worker=parameters.worker` parameter (also cleaned up)

### `README.md`
- Removed all ICM references from feature lists
- Removed ICM module from architecture diagrams
- Removed ICM connections in mermaid diagrams
- Removed ICM from algorithm flow (step 10)
- Removed ICM from key features annotations
- Removed ICM from project structure
- Updated text to remove curiosity-driven exploration mentions

### `CUSTOM_RL_GUIDE.md`
- Removed entire ICM section from "What are Munchausen RL and ICM?"
- Updated title to "What is Munchausen RL?"
- Removed ICM from core features list
- Removed ICM from advanced features examples
- Removed ICM from file structure
- Removed ICM-related troubleshooting
- Removed ICM custom implementation section
- Updated financial use case to remove ICM analysis
- Removed ICM command-line examples

## Result
✅ The codebase now focuses solely on the proven D4PG algorithm with:
- Distributional learning (IQN)
- Munchausen RL for entropy regularization
- Prioritized Experience Replay (PER)
- N-step bootstrapping
- Performance optimizations

✅ All imports work correctly
✅ Code compiles without errors
✅ Documentation is consistent and updated
